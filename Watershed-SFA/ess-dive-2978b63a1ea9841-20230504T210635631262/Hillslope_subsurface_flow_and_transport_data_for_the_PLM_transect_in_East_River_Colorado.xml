Water Resources Research.</para>          <para>Drilling, instrumentation, and monitoring.</para>          <para>A track mounted drill rig was used to drill five boreholes in September 2016. Sites PLM1-4 were drilled down to a depth of 10.0 m below ground surface (bgs) with a 0.14 m diameter ODEX bit, with ejected drill cuttings collected in 0.6 to 0.75 m depth increments. An additional borehole (PLM6) was first drilled to obtain core samples, then for installation of a 0.051 m ID monitoring well slotted over the depth interval of 6.10 to 9.15 m bgs. The hillslope boreholes (PLM1,2,3) were instrumented to monitor vadose zone and groundwater interactions in a manner similar to that of a previous study [Tokunaga et al., 2016; Wan et al., 2018]. Most instrument packages included a pore water sampler (Soilmoisture Equipment 1920F1L06-B02M2), matric potential sensor (Decagon MPS-6), water content sensor (Decagon 5TE), and gas sampler (1.3 cm diameter, 2.6 cm long porous stainless steel filter tips, 50 μm pores, McMaster-Carr). Tubing (1/4 inch OD, stainless steel for gas 32 samplers and nylon for water samplers) and electrical leads (MPS-6 and 5TE) were bundled together in lengths sufficient to extend above ground. For installation of instruments, a pump was lowered to the bottom of the hole to drain inflowing water and to allow video inspection of the borehole wall for identifying fractured zones to target for instrumentation. The camera and pump were removed, and specific depth intervals were equipped with instrument clusters, backfilled with 150 to 425 μm silica sand (typically 15 to 30 cm below and above instruments), and isolated with bentonite (3/8” chips). The uppermost segments of boreholes were backfilled with native soil. The shallowest instruments were emplaced in individual 0.09 m diameter holes, hand-augered to the desired depth. It should be noted that flow of shallow sediments under positive pore pressures of the near-river floodplain environment caused the original PLM4 borehole to collapse before instruments could be installed. Therefore, the PLM4 instruments were only installed to 1.28 m bgs, in individual hand-augered boreholes.</para>        </description>      </methodStep>      <methodStep>        <description>          <para>Soil sampling and characterization.</para>          <para>Prior to drilling, soils were collected in 0.10 m depth increments by hand augering and coring, with samples sealed in Ziploc freezer bags and shipped back to the laboratory. These sample were used to determine depth profiles of particle-size distributions, and water potential profiles. The latter were determined with a Decagon WP4C, on subsamples taken from interior regions of intact cores and aggregates. An additional set of soil samples were collected in September 2018 at the hillslope stations for additional water potential measurements.</para>        </description>      </methodStep>      <methodStep>        <description>          <para>Hydraulic conductivities.</para>          <para>Hydraulic conductivities of soils along the hillslope were measured with a Guelph permeameter [Reynolds and Elrick, 1987; Zhang et al., 1998]. The Guelph permeameter was also used to obtain measurements of K at a depth of 1.40 m within weathering shale in the vicinity of PLM3 and PLM6. Hydraulic conductivities in the fractured shale where measured at PLM1 (6.3 to 7.3 m depth bgs screened) and PLM6 (4.8 to 9.8 m depth bgs screened), based on bailing and monitoring water level recovery rates [Bouwer and Rice, 1976].</para>        </description>      </methodStep>      <methodStep>        <description>          <para>Hydraulic potentials.</para>          <para>Water table depths at PLM1 and PLM6 were monitored with continuously logging pressure transducers (AquaTROLL 200) that were periodically checked with manual tape measurements of depths to water. Depths to the water table at PLM1, 2, and 3 were also obtained from equilibrium pressure measurements in pore water samplers using the “tensisampler” approach [Tokunaga, 1992]. Although equilibrated tensisampler readings have high accuracy (±0.02 m H2O) for low magnitude matric head, response time limitations make them unreliable for matric head values more negative than about -1 m H2O. On the other hand, MPS-6 measurements are not able to resolve matric and pressure head greater than -1.0 m H2O. Therefore, by combining MPS-6 and tensisampler measurements, a very wide range of matric/pressure potentials can be monitored without loss of resolution at near-zero matric/pressure potentials [Tokunaga, 1992][Tokunaga, 1992]. Procedures involved in estimating the depth of the water table based on trends in moisture and matric potential sensors (Decagon 5TE and MPS-6, respectively) are provided in the Supporting Information (SI). At individual stations, vertical hydraulic head profiles take their local soil surface as the gravitation potential datum. Coordinates and elevations at the soil surface of each PLM station, were determined by GPS, thereby allowing determination of hydraulic head gradients across the hillslope transect.</para>        </description>      </methodStep>      <methodStep>        <description>          <para>Pore water sampling and analyses.</para>          <para>Pore water samples were collected at intervals ranging from weekly to approximately monthly, excluding winter months when collections were not possible, usually because of ice in aboveground tubing. Prior to sample collection, the air head space pressure was measured with a Tensimeter (Soil Measurement Systems) for determination of the matric/pressure head. Shallow pore water samples were collected via hand vacuum pump into a sampling flask, while deeper samples required pressure-lift using a bicycle pump. Pore water specific conductance (SC) was measured with a VWR 61161 meter, and non-purgeable organic carbon (referred to here as dissolved organic carbon, DOC) was measured with a Shimadzu TOC-VCPH analyzer.</para>        </description>      </methodStep>      <methodStep>        <description>          <para>Water isotopic analyses.</para>          <para>The stable isotope compositions of groundwater deuterium D and  84 18O have been widely used to determine sources of the groundwater [McDonnell and Kendall, 1998]. Both snow (light isotopic compositions) and groundwater (heavier isotopic compositions) samples were collected for water analyses. A series of 4 snow pits were sampled in early March 2017 along a transect extending from above PLM1 (elevation of 2900 m, Figure 1) down to the floodplain near PLM4, before the beginning of significant snowmelt. Groundwater samples for isotopic analyses were collected from the deeper pore water samplers at PLM1-3 on an approximately monthly basis from December 2016 through August 2018. Water isotopic analyses were done at the Center for Isotope Geochemistry at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory using a Los Gatos Research Liquid Water Isotope Analyzer (LWIA). 1.2 mL of each sample was filtered and loaded into vials on the auto-sampler associated with the LWIA. Each sample was injected into the analyzer 8 times and the first 3 data points were discarded to avoid any effects resulting from carryover between samples. The remaining data points were averaged and corrected based on the results of internal standards with known isotopic compositions analyzed every third sample. Hydrogen and oxygen isotope ratios are reported using the conventional  notation relative to Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water (VSMOW).</para>        </description>      </methodStep>      <methodStep>        <description>          <para>Transmissivity feedback calculations of subsurface flow.</para>          <para>Based on higher K associated with shallower depths, relatively uniform rise and decline of the water table within the instrumented section of the hillslope, and lack of evidence for surface runoff and perched water tables, transmissivity calculations were applied to characterize subsurface flow from the hillslope transect towards the river. This approach calculates fluxes through zones below the dynamic water table based on the product of water table height-dependent transmissivities and the average hydraulic head gradient. Based on both the K values and pore water chemistries, the subsurface was simplified into a 0.5 m thick surface soil zone, a 0.5 m thick subsoil zone, 2.6 m thick weathering shale zone, and an underlying fractured shale of thickness to be estimated through a water mass balance calculation. The average water table measured within the monitored transect was used to determine the time-dependent transmissivity of the soil, weathering shale, and fractured shale. Within each zone, the average of measured K is multiplied by its water table elevation-dependent saturated thickness to obtain its time-dependent transmissivity. The influence of capillarity in enhancing the thickness of the effectively saturated soil was approximated by applying hysteretic tension saturation matric head values of -0.05 (estimated) and -0.12 (measured) m for wetting and draining, respectively, based on soil moisture retention relations.</para>        </description>      </methodStep>      <methodStep>        <description>          <para>Calculated concentrations of solute discharges from the hillslope.</para>          <para>The time-dependent transmissivity-based pore water fluxes through the soil, weathering shale, and fracture shale zones were combined with their corresponding major ion (represented by SC) and DOC concentrations to estimate the exports of these solutes from the hillslope into the floodplain. More specifically, concentrations in each layer were scaled by their associated fractional fluxes (to generate flow-weighted concentrations in the discharging pore waters. Because the SC and DOC data were not obtained continuously, three different approximations were applied to them. Each of these approaches is analogous to three-component mass balance models used to generate watershed concentration-discharge (C-Q) relations [Chanat et al., 2002], but are based on different ways of treating measured subsurface concentrations and calculated fluxes, and do not include overland flow. Specifically,</para>          <para>Cdischarge(t) = Fsoil(t)·Csoil + Fws(t)·Cws + Ffs(t)·Cfs</para>          <para>where the Fi(t) are the fractional fluxes determined by each zone’s transmissive downslope flux relative to the total downslope flow, subscripts ws and fs refer to the weathering shale and fractured shale zones, respectively, and zonal Ci are different in the three approaches. Because of the sparse availability of pore waters from the soil, pore waters were not subdivided into surface soil and subsoil zones. The first approach simply used the average of all data (SC or DOC) available within each zone (soil, weathering shale, fractured shale) to represent the zone-specific constant concentration. This procedure is satisfactory only for the fractured shale, and that the true time-average concentrations are likely higher in the soil and weathering zones because the less frequently recovered summer through winter pore waters are expected to have higher solute concentrations. Therefore, the second approach used the time-averaged value of estimated concentration trends in each zone, i.e. averaged the continuous curves. Although the curves are qualitative, they capture both the important influence of dilution during and shortly after snowmelt recharge events and the typically more concentrated (yet under-sampled because of lower matric potentials) pore waters associated with summer through winter. The third approach to estimating the composite concentrations in discharging hillslope pore waters attempts to be more realistic, through weighting time-dependent concentrations by their relative fluxes. This last approach amounted to weighting the continuous curves by their associated fractional fluxes.</para>        </description>      </methodStep>    </methods>    <project id="024b867d-25e3-4025-b68c-6598aded7aa2" scope="system" system="ess-dive">      <title>Watershed Function SFA</title>      <personnel>        <individualName>          <givenName>Eoin</givenName>          <surName>Brodie</surName>        </individualName>        <organizationName>Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory</organizationName>        <electronicMailAddress>elbrodie@lbl.gov</electronicMailAddress>        <role>Principal Investigator</role>      </personnel>    </project>    <otherEntity id="ess-dive-e4aedb21f754891-20191203T214455827">      <entityName>data_for_Tokunaga_et_al___Water_Resources_Research_2019c.xlsx</entityName>      <entityType>application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet</entityType>    </otherEntity>    <otherEntity id="ess-dive-cdefefd878b1fba-20191203T214846802">      <entityName>Tokunaga_et_al___Supporting_Information_revised.pdf</entityName>      <entityType>application/pdf</entityType>    </otherEntity>  </dataset></eml:eml>
