However, legacy nitrate (NO3-) contamination in agriculturally-intensive regions poses a threat to groundwater resources under AgMAR. To address these concerns, we use a reactive transport modeling framework to better understand the effects of AgMAR management strategies (i.e., by varying the frequency, duration between flooding events, and amount of water) on N leaching to groundwater under different stratigraphic configurations and antecedent moisture conditions. In particular, we examine the potential of denitrification and nitrogen retention in deep vadose zone sediments (~15 m) using variable AgMAR application rates on two-dimensional representations of differently textured soils, soils with discontinuous bands/channels, and soils with preferential flow paths characteristic of typical agricultural field sites. Our results indicate that finer textured sediments, such as silt loams, alone or embedded within high flow regions, are important reducing zones providing conditions needed for denitrification. Simulation results further suggest that applying water all-at-once rather than in increments for a fixed volume of recharge transports higher concentrations of NO3- deeper into the profile, which has the potential to exacerbate groundwater quality. This transport into deeper depths can be aggravated by wetter antecedent soil moisture conditions. However, applying water all-at-once also increases denitrification within the vadose zone by promoting anoxic conditions. We conclude that AgMAR management strategies can be designed to enhance denitrification in the subsurface and reduce N leaching to groundwater, while specifically accounting for lithologic heterogeneity, antecedent soil moisture conditions, and depth to the water table. Our findings are potentially relevant to other systems that experience flooding inundation such as riparian corridors, floodplains, wetlands, and other managed landscapes like dedicated recharge basins.</para>    </abstract>    <keywordSet xmlns:sw="eml://ecoinformatics.org/software-2.1.1" xmlns:cit="eml://ecoinformatics.org/literature-2.1.1" xmlns:ds="eml://ecoinformatics.org/dataset-2.1.1" xmlns:prot="eml://ecoinformatics.org/protocol-2.1.1" xmlns:doc="eml://ecoinformatics.org/documentation-2.1.1" xmlns:res="eml://ecoinformatics.org/resource-2.1.1" xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema">      <keyword>Managed Aquifer Recharge</keyword>      <keyword>Nitrogen Cycling and Transport</keyword>      <keyword>Agricultural Lands</keyword>      <keyword>AgMAR</keyword>      <keyword>Groundwater Quality</keyword>      <keyword>Modeling</keyword>      <keywordThesaurus>CATEGORICAL:NONE</keywordThesaurus>    </keywordSet>    <intellectualRights xmlns:sw="eml://ecoinformatics.org/software-2.1.1" xmlns:cit="eml://ecoinformatics.org/literature-2.1.1" xmlns:ds="eml://ecoinformatics.org/dataset-2.1.1" xmlns:prot="eml://ecoinformatics.org/protocol-2.1.1" xmlns:doc="eml://ecoinformatics.org/documentation-2.1.1" xmlns:res="eml://ecoinformatics.org/resource-2.1.1" xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema">      <para>This work is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.

ERT profiles were generated along a 150 m transect to 20 m depth prior to flooding to quantify subsurface heterogeneity while the subsurface was relatively dry (Figure 3). Further, to validate the texture profiles generated by the ERT data, a set of six cores were taken along the transect of the ERT line down to nine meters with a Geoprobe push-drill system (Geoprobe Systems, Salina, KS). The first meter of the core was sampled every 25 cm. Thereafter, cores were sampled based on stratigraphy as determined by changes in color or texture. The ERT profiles were used to develop the stratigraphic modeling scenarios and the coring guided the specification of the hydraulic parameters. Redoximorphic features (i.e., changes in concentration and depletion of Fe) were noted throughout the cores.</para>        </description>      </methodStep>      <methodStep>        <description>          <para>Texture was analyzed using a modified pipette method whereby 5 g of soil were placed in 50 mL centrifuge tubes with 40 mL of 0.5% sodium phosphate and shaken overnight (Soil Survey Laboratory Methods Manual, 2004). Samples were hand shaken immediately before a 2.5 mL aliquot was taken 11 seconds (sand fraction) and 1 hour and 51 minutes (clay fraction), respectively after shaking and placed in a pre-weighed tin. Tins were oven dried at 105°C overnight and reweighed the next day.  Silt fractions were calculated by subtracting the sand and clay fraction from 1.</para>          <para>Nitrate (NO3-) and ammonium (NH4+) were analyzed by weighing 8-10 g of soil into a 50-mL centrifuge tube and extracted with 2M KCl. Samples were centrifuged and the supernatant was analyzed colorimetrically for soil NO3- and NH4+ using a UV mini 1240, Shimadzu spectrophotometer as per methods described in Doane and Horwath (2003). Gravimetric water content was determined after soil samples were dried over night at 105° C. Total nitrogen (N) and soil organic carbon (SOC) were measured via combustion on a Costech ECS 4010 CHNSO elemental analyzer using soil samples that were dried at 60° C and pulverized using a ball mill. Samples were checked for carbonates using a 1 mol L-1 hydrochloric acid (HCl) solution prior to combustion. A 1:1 water to soil ratio was placed in a falcon tube, shaken for an hour, allowed to settle, and the supernatant pH measured (Thomas, 1996).</para>          <para>Total reactive iron was measured by extracting 1 g of soil with 0.25 M hydroxylamine hydrochloride and 0.25 M HCl, shaking for 1 hour, and reacting with ferrozine (3-(2-pyridyl)-5,6-diphenyl-1,2,4-triazine-4’,4”-disulfonate) and measured at 565 nm on a spectrophotometer (Lovley and Phillips 1987, Stookey 1970, Violler et al. 2000). Sulfur and manganese were determined on the supernatant of the same solution by the UC Davis ICPMS. Using a 1:4 ratio of soil to 0.5 M K2SO4, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was extracted, shaken for 1 hour, centrifuged for 10 min at 3000xg, and analyzed on a UV-persulfate total organic carbon analyzer (Phoenix 8000, Tekmar Dohrmann™, Cincinnati, OH).</para>        </description>      </methodStep>      <methodStep>        <description>          <para>Soil cores taken after the AgMAR event were used to carry out microcosm experiments under anaerobic conditions in a helium atmosphere at 22°C to determine denitrification capacity according to a modified method by Groffman et al. (1999) and detailed in Waterhouse et al. (2020, in prep). Briefly, 10 g of air-dried soil from each depth were added to autoclaved 135 ml glass vials. To assess denitrification capacity, 15 ml of sterilized deionized (DI) water was added to the vials without any addition of NO3- or carbon substrates. Vials were capped with autoclaved butyl rubber septa, flushed with helium for 10 minutes to create anoxic conditions, after which 10% by volume acetylene was added to the vials to prevent the conversion of N2O to N2. Gas samples from the headspace were taken at 30 minutes, 90 minutes, 24 hours, and 3 days.. The N2O and CO2 measurements after the third and final day of the incubation were used to inform the reaction rate parameters for denitrification. In particular, we used the Q10 equation to adjust the reaction parameters. This is because the Q10 equation can account for the temperature sensitivity of the reaction by calculating the change in the rate of a reaction given a 10 °C change in temperature (Kirschbaum, 1995). Given that our field site temperatures were lower during the winter (mean of 18 °C) than the temperatures at which the denitrification capacity assays were incubated, we estimated the reaction rate using the following equation (Meyer et al. 2018):</para>          <para>R_2=R_1  x Q_10^((T_2-T_1)/10)                                                                                                       [1]</para>          <para>where R1 and R2 are the reaction rates at two different temperatures, T1 and T2 (°C), respectively, and Q10 is the factor by which the reaction rate increases when the temperature is raised by ten degrees.</para>        </description>      </methodStep>      <methodStep>        <description>          <para>Statistical analysis was used to help guide the development of the geochemical reaction network. First, correlation analysis was used to inform the choices of primary geochemical species on the basis of the strength of their relationship with N2O. Second, on the basis of cluster analysis, stratigraphic configurations with different textural classes were developed. In particular, a Spearman’s rank correlation was conducted on the dataset including several physical and geochemical measurements collected on the soil cores. Specific variables included pH, N2O, NO3-, NH4+, DOC, Fe, Mn, S, total C, percent sand, silt, and clay, and depth. Variables were standardized using the median and mean absolute distance because most variables were found to be non-normally distributed based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Correlations between variables with p-values less than 0.05 were considered to be significant. To further understand how the data grouped, a cluster analysis was conducted using the partitioning around medoids method for the same set of variables. Interestingly, data were found to group according to textural classes and depth, which provides a mechanism to develop the modeling strategy around these textural profiles.</para>        </description>      </methodStep>      <methodStep>        <description>          <para>Several scenarios were developed based on the soil textures identified in cores and the ERT profiles to provide insights into the effect of stratigraphic heterogeneity and AgMAR management strategies on NO3- cycling in the deep subsurface, as described in section 2 above. The five stratigraphies modeled in this study are shown in Figure 1. The limiting layer in the ERT scenario spans 187 to 234 cm-bgs (below ground surface) based on field core observations. For each lithologic profile, three AgMAR management strategies were imposed at the top boundary between 20 m and 150 m of each modeled profile (Figure 1). For each AgMAR management strategy, the same overall amount of water was applied, but the frequency, duration between flooding events, and amount of water applied in each flooding event varied (as shown in Figure 1): a total of 68 cm of water was applied either all at once (scenario S1), in increments of 17 cm once a week for four weeks (scenario S2), in increments of 17 cm twice a week for two weeks (scenario S3), and all three scenarios with an initially wetter moisture profile (Figure 1). Note, that for all scenarios, the same reactions were considered, the water table was maintained at 15 m, and temperature was fixed across depths at 18°C, the mean air temperature for January to February in Modesto.</para>          <para>For all scenarios, the modeling domain consists of a two-dimensional 20-meter deep vertical cross-section extending laterally 2,190 m and including a 190 m wide zone of interest located at its center, thus distant from lateral boundaries on each side by 1,000 m to avoid boundary effects. The zone of interest was discretized using a total of 532 grid blocks with a uniform grid spacing of 1 m along the horizontal axis, and a vertical grid spacing of 0.02 m in the unsaturated zone increasing with depth to 1 m in the saturated zone. A maximum time step of 1 day was specified for all simulated scenarios, although the actual time step was limited by specifying a Courant Number of 0.5, typically resulting in much smaller time steps during early stages of flooding.</para>          <para>Before each flooding simulation, the model was run first to hydrologic steady state conditions including the effect of average (background) rainfall (33 cm year-1). The water table was set at a depth of 15 m by specifying a constant pressure at the bottom model boundary (1.5 x 105 Pa at a depth of 20 m), and the model side boundaries (1000 m away from the zone of interest) were set to no-flow conditions.</para>          <para>Under these hydrologic conditions, the model was then run for a 100-yr time period including biogeochemical reactions and fixed atmospheric conditions of O2 and CO2 partial pressures at the top boundary, a period after which essentially steady biogeochemical conditions were achieved, including the development of progressively reducing conditions with depth representative of field conditions. For these simulations, the concentrations of dissolved species in background precipitation and in groundwater at the bottom model boundary were fixed, with compositions described in Table 2 to yield similar vertically distributed NO3- concentrations as were measured in the soil cores.</para>          <para>Flooding scenarios were then started from the initially steady flow and biogeochemical conditions developed as described above and run for 60 days. For these simulations, a free surface boundary was implemented for scenario S1 where 68 cm of water was applied all at once.  In contrast, a specified flux boundary condition was imposed for the scenarios S2-S3, where floodwater applications were broken up over a week. The flood water composition is discussed in Section 2.3.5.</para>        </description>      </methodStep>      <methodStep>        <description>          <para>The key geochemical processes included in this study are aqueous speciation, ion exchange, mineral precipitation/dissolution reactions, and microbially mediated redox reactions.
