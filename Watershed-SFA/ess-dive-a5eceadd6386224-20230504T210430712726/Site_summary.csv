Read me:,This data package is divided into 4 use cases that correspond to the 4 scenerios described in Chen et al. 2020 (in review). ,,,,,,,,
Use Case 1,This use case mainly include Fluxnet sites and simulated ET and RECO results from HPM. The objective for this use case is to test HPM's capability for estimating flux over time,,,,,,,,
Use Case 2,This use case aims at testing HPM's capability for estimating flux over space with one Fluxnet used for model development and another site in the same ecoregion for validation,,,,,,,,
Use Case 3,"This use case involves simulated ET data from CLM at Snotel sites. Weather forcing inputs from Daymet, SNOTEL are combined together.",,,,,,,,
Use Case 4,"This use case includes 16 locations selected at the East River Watershed with 4 distinctive vegetation types, including deciduous forests (DF), evergreen forests (EF), riparian shrubland (RS) and meadow grassland (MS)",,,,,,,,
Fluxnet and SNOTEL sites,,Original fluxnet data can be acquired from fluxnet.fluxdata.org,,,,,,,
