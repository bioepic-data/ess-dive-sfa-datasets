PH_Streamflow,"Data used to quantify integrated watershed processes.Â Discharge calculations based on a rating cuve approach. Two ISCOs serve the site. One to collect anions, cations, trace metals, DIC and NOPC. The second collects samples for stable isotopes with each bottle filled with approx. 2 cm oil to minimize evaproation between sample retrival.Â Â ISCOs collect from the stream during ice-free days (April through October) and sample from winter storage (WS) November through March.",ER-PHF0,-9999,N/A,2760.438891,meters above mean sea level,Pumphouse ISCO,N/A,freshwater river [ENVO:01000297],Open water column,2014,-9999,-7:00:00
Bradley_Streamflow,"Data used to quantify seasonal and interannual hydrologic response and mass flux of solutes at the sub-catchment scale. Rating curved approach applied to pressure transducer data.
