We measured subsoil carbon in warmed vs control plots of a conifer forest after 4.5 years of whole-soil warming (4°C). We also measured soil CO2 efflux at the surface and soil CO2 concentrations along the soil profile. Over the 4.5 years we observed that warming resulted in a loss of subsoil carbon stocks (−33 ± 11%), primarily from unprotected particulate organic matter. Warming also stimulated a sustained 30 ± 4% increase in soil CO2 efflux due to increased CO2 production through the whole-soil profile. The observed in situ decline in subsoil carbon stocks with warming is now definitive evidence of a positive soil carbon-climate feedback, which could not be concluded based on increases in CO2 effluxes alone. </para>      <para>This dataset comprises (1) 13C and C recovery in 2014, 2016, and 2018 1m soil cores sampled in 10cm increments.

It is a mixed coniferous forest of mainly ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), sugar pine (Pinus lamberiana), incense cedar (Calodefrus decurrens), white fir (Abies concolor), and douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), located below the permanent winter snowline. Mean annual precipitation is 166 cm, with most of it occurring from November to April. The mean annual temperature is approximately 12.5°C. The soils are classified generally as Alfisols and are described as Holland series, fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Ultic Haploxeralfs of granitic origin with thick, &gt;5-cm O horizons.</para>        </description>      </methodStep>      <methodStep>        <description>          <para>Experimental design</para>          <para>The soil warming experiment began in October 2013 when heaters were turned on to warm the soil 4°C above ambient to 1 m depth while maintaining the natural temperature. Briefly, the experiment consists of three blocks of replicated, warmed-control paired plots, and each plot is 3 m in diameter. Warming is maintained throughout the plot and down to 1 m depth with 22, 2.4-m-long resistance heating cables (BriskHeat, Ohio, USA) installed vertically in 1″ diameter metal conduit spaced 50 cm apart and 0.25 m outside the edge of the plots. Two concentric rings of heater cable at 1 and 2 m in diameter and 5 cm in depth were installed within the plots to compensate for surface heat loss. Similarly, we installed vertical conduit around and two concentric rings of unheated cables in the control plots.</para>          <para>We used temperature sensors (Omega 44005) to monitor soil temperature every 10 s at 5, 15, 20, 30, 50, 70, 75, and 100 cm in all plots. We used enviroSCAN (Sentek, Australia) probes fitted with capacitance sensors at 10, 30, 50, and 90 cm in each plot, which were calibrated five times in both dry and wet periods to monitor soil volumetric water content. We used dataloggers (CR1000, Campbell Scientific, Utah, USA) to record soil temperature and moisture values continuously and created a program that adjusted the power to the heaters every 10 min based on soil temperatures in the control plots to maintain a targeted 4°C warming in the paired heated plots. Temperature sensors at 15 and 20 cm were queried to control the power supply to the shallow heaters, while temperature sensors at 70 and 75 cm were queried to control power supply to deep heaters.</para>          <para>Each plot contains five, ¼′′ diameter stainless steel, septa-topped, gas sampling tubes permanently installed at a 45° angle. These are used to sample soil gas from 15, 30, 50, 70, and 90 cm and to model CO2 production from between these depth increments within the soil profile. Each plot is also equipped with two porous quartz tipped sampling tubes with an average pore size of 2 μm (Prenart Super Quartz Sampler, Prenart equipment, Frederiksberg, Denmark) used to collect soil pore water samples to measure dissolved organic matter concentrations. The pore water samplers were initially coated with silica flower and installed at a 30° angle, one at 20 cm and one at 70 cm, to collect shallow and deep soil pore water samples via vacuum suction. We collected soil pore water samples into acid washed vials when possible after rain and snow melt events in the winter and spring (five times in winter 2013–2014, three times in winter 2014–2015, eight times in 2015–2016, zero times in 2016–2017, and five times in 2017–2018).</para>        </description>      </methodStep>      <methodStep>        <description>          <para>Bulk soil analysis</para>          <para>We collected two soil cores (4.8 cm in diameter) divided into approximately 10-cm-depth increments down to 90 cm from each plot on 4 April 2018. The first core was stored at 4°C until it could be sieved, which was completed within 1 week of sampling. We sieved the samples through a 2-mm mesh to separate soil (&lt;2 mm) from roots and stones (&gt;2 mm). Roots longer than 1 cm that passed through the 2-mm sieve were also picked from the soil with forceps. We weighed a subsample of the moist soil and after drying at 105°C to calculate gravimetric water content. A subsample of the soil was ground with stainless steel balls on a roller mill for 48 hours and then analyzed by Elemental Analyzer-Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometry (EA-IRMS; Isoprime 100 IRMS in line with a Vario micro cube EA, Isoprime, UK) for carbon concentration and δ13C. The second core was freeze-dried and then sieved to 2 mm. A subsample from each depth increment of the second core was ground in a ball mill (MM400, Retsch, Haan, Germany) and analyzed by EA-IRMS (Flash, 2000-HT Plus, linked by Conflo IV to Delta V Plus IRMS) for carbon concentration and δ13C. Results from both cores are presented as mean values for each plot.</para>          <para>Bulk density measurements were taken from three soil pits adjacent to the experimental plots in 2014. Each pit was 1 m3, and horizontal soil cores with a diameter of 6 cm were carefully excavated to measure soil bulk density. Total bulk density was used for calculation of diffusivity for CO2 production measurements, but bulk density of the soil &lt;2 mm after sieving was used for calculations of SOC stocks. We used the mean bulk density from the three pit measurements as one estimate for bulk density for all plots in our experiment. We calculated SOC stocks by multiplying this single bulk density value (g soil cm−3) by carbon concentration (g C g soil−1) from each soil core. For calculation of SE we first calculated the difference in SOC stocks between warmed and control cores for each core pair within each plot pair. An average value for each plot pair was then used to calculate SD and SE (n = 3) from each plot. We could not take accurate bulk density measurements from our long-term warming experiment plots themselves, because digging a pit large enough to take horizontal cores would be too much of a disturbance to these long-term plots. Bulk density is typically inversely related to soil organic matter content. Therefore, it is possible that the loss of SOC stocks due to warming reported here is slightly underestimated if warming also led to increased bulk density. Total SOC stocks below 20 cm were calculated by summing the SOC stocks measured in 10-cm increments from 20 to 90 cm for each plot.</para>        </description>      </methodStep>      <methodStep>        <description>          <para>Soil organic matter fractionation</para>          <para>In June 2017, one soil core (4.4 cm in diameter) from each field plot was collected for bulk soil analysis and soil organic matter physical fractionation. Bulk soil samples from three depths—10 to 14, 44 to 49, and 85 to 89 cm—were sieved to 2 mm to separate bulk soil from roots and stones, following which bulk soil and roots were freeze dried. A 20-g sample of freeze dried soil was then separated into fPOM (free light fraction), aggregate oPOM (occluded light fraction), and MAOM (dense fraction) using a sodium polytungstate solution (1.7 g ml−1) and sonication. Mass recovery after fractionation was ±2%. A bulk soil sample and each soil organic matter fraction were ground and analyzed for carbon concentration, δ13C, and δ15N by EA-IRMS (Isoprime 100 IRMS in line with a Vario micro cube EA, Isoprime, UK).</para>        </description>      </methodStep>      <methodStep>        <description>          <para>Soil CO2 efflux</para>          <para>We measured surface soil respiration (efflux) approximately monthly from March 2014 to December 2018 using an infrared gas analyzer (Licor LI-6400, Licor, Lincoln, Nebraska, USA) or a cross-calibrated cavity ring down spectrometer (Picarro, Santa Clara, California, USA), fitted with a 10-cm-diameter opaque chamber on seven permanently installed PVC collars in each plot. There were 8 sampling dates in 2014, 11 in 2015, 8 in 2016, 9 in 2017, and 10 in 2018.</para>        </description>      </methodStep>      <methodStep>        <description>          <para>Soil profile CO2 production</para>          <para>On the same days as the surface soil respiration measurements, we collected soil gas samples from the gas sampling tubes with a syringe and stored them in evacuated glass vials. We sampled soil gas from 6.35-mm-diameter stainless steel tubes inserted to 15, 30, 50, 70, and 90 cm within the soil profile and sealed at the surface with swage pipefittings (Swagelok Ohio, USA) and septa. We measured CO2 concentration on the soil gas samples by syringe injection via gas chromatography (Shimadzu 2014, Shimadzu Scientific Instruments Inc., USA).</para>          <para>We modeled depth-resolved CO2 production using the flux gradient approach from soil CO2 concentrations collected approximately monthly. The CO2 production for the volume of soil between the shallowest soil gas sample (15 cm) and the soil surface was calculated using the flux estimate at the shallowest soil gas sample depth and the surface flux measurement, which was measured on the same day. The mean annual CO2 production warming response from each plot was calculated as the mean warming effect of all sampling dates for each plot per year.</para>        </description>      </methodStep>      <methodStep>        <description>          <para>DOC and dissolved nitrogen</para>          <para>Soil pore water samples were stored frozen until analysis. They were diluted with Nanopure water and analyzed for DOC and total dissolved nitrogen concentrations (Shimadzu TOC-L, Shimadzu Scientific Instruments Inc., USA). Dissolved inorganic carbon was measured on the samples collected in 2014 (Shimadzu TOC-VCPH analyzer, Shimadzu Corporation, Japan) and was found to comprise &lt;1% of the total dissolved carbon, so we report the total dissolved carbon as DOC concentrations. Inorganic nitrogen (NO3−, NO2−, and NH4+) were measured on an Alpkem Flow Solution IV Automated wet chemistry system (O.I. Analytical, College Station, TX), and dissolved organic nitrogen was calculated as the difference between total and inorganic nitrogen. Inorganic nitrogen concentrations were often below detection limit (0.5 mg N/liter).</para>        </description>      </methodStep>      <methodStep>        <description>          <para>Microbial biomass</para>          <para>We took two 10-g subsamples of the field-moist soil from 0- to 10-cm-, 10-to 20-cm-, 30- to 40-cm-, 50- to 60-cm-, and 80- to 90-cm-depth increments from the first core of the April 2018 sampling to measure microbial biomass carbon using chloroform fumigation extraction. All extractions were completed within 1 week of field sampling, and samples were stored in air tight bags at 4°C until extraction. Briefly, one subsample was extracted by shaking in 0.05 M K2SO4 for 1 hour and filtering over a Whatman #1, ash-free filter. The second subsample was first fumigated with chloroform under vacuum for 5 days and then extracted in the same way. The extracts were analyzed for total organic carbon on a Shimadzu TOC-L (Shimadzu Scientific Instruments Inc., USA). Microbial biomass carbon was calculated as the difference between the chloroform-fumigated and nonfumigated concentrations on a dry-soil basis. We used a 0.45 extraction efficiency correction factor to report microbial biomass values at comparable scales to those reported by Xu et al. 2013.</para>        </description>      </methodStep>    </methods>    <project id="9cc37650-e339-4174-b9ba-a659d6fb244c" scope="system" system="ess-dive">      <title>Belowground Biogeochemistry Scientific Focus Area</title>      <personnel>        <individualName>          <givenName>Margaret</givenName>          <surName>Torn</surName>        </individualName>        <organizationName>Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory</organizationName>        <electronicMailAddress>mstorn@lbl.gov</electronicMailAddress>        <role>Principal Investigator</role>      </personnel>    </project>    <otherEntity id="ess-dive-12ab36f35ea7f92-20221020T222137843">      <entityName>ESSDive_5yr_SurfaceFlux.csv</entityName>      <entityType>text/csv</entityType>    </otherEntity>    <otherEntity id="ess-dive-ab7d7598e4ebff7-20221020T222137818">      <entityName>ESSDive_5yr_Blodgett_SOM_fracs.csv</entityName>      <entityType>text/csv</entityType>    </otherEntity>    <otherEntity id="ess-dive-71f7d3a22be613c-20221020T222137831">      <entityName>ESSDive_5yr_CN_BD_MB.csv</entityName>      <entityType>text/csv</entityType>    </otherEntity>    <otherEntity id="ess-dive-d5640915cead298-20221020T222137836">      <entityName>ESSDive_5yr_GasWell_Data.csv</entityName>      <entityType>text/csv</entityType>    </otherEntity>    <otherEntity id="ess-dive-5c5befd6cd4aa01-20221028T214516487">      <entityName>DataFileDescriptions.pdf</entityName>      <entityType>application/pdf</entityType>    </otherEntity>  </dataset></eml:eml>
