Fe and Al can be strong predictors of SOC storage and turnover in soils with relatively high extractable metals content and moderately acidic to circumneutral pH. Here we test whether pedogenic Fe and Al influence SOC content and turnover in soils with low Fe and Al content and acidic pH. In soils from four sites spanning three soil orders, we quantified the amount of Fe and Al in operationally-defined poorly crystalline and organically-complexed phases using selective chemical dissolution applied to the soil fraction containing mineral-associated carbon. We evaluated the correlations of Fe and Al concentrations, mean annual precipitation (MAP), mean annual temperature (MAT), and pH with SOC content and 14C-based turnover times. We found that poorly crystalline Fe and Al content predicted SOC turnover times (p &lt; 0.0001) consistent with findings of previous studies, while organically-complexed Fe and Al content was a better predictor of SOC concentration (p &lt; 0.0001). Greater site-level MAP (p &lt; 0.0001) and colder site-level MAT (p &lt; 0.0001) were correlated with longer SOC turnover times but were not correlated with SOC content. Our results suggest that poorly crystalline Fe and Al effectively slow the turnover of SOC in these acidic soils, even when their combined content in the soil is less than 2% by mass. However, in the strongly acidic Spodosol, organo-metal complexes tended to be less stable resulting in a more actively cycling mineral-associated SOC pool. </para>      <para>We characterized mineralogy and carbon content in soils from four forested sites in the eastern deciduous forest zone that span three soil orders. Using selective chemical dissolution applied to the soil fraction containing mineral-associated carbon, we quantified the amount of Fe and Al in operationally-defined poorly crystalline and organically-complexed phases, and correlated these with previously published SOC content and 14C-based turnover times (McFarlane et al. 2013). </para>      <para>This dataset comprises site characterization undertaken in 2007 (.png) and subsequent soil analyses (.csv containing C, Fe, Al, 14C-derived TurnoverTime) concluded in 2010.</para>    </abstract>    <keywordSet>      <keyword>EARTH SCIENCE &gt; LAND SURFACE &gt; SOILS</keyword>      <keywordThesaurus>CATEGORICAL:GCMD</keywordThesaurus>    </keywordSet>    <keywordSet>      <keyword>EARTH SCIENCE &gt; LAND SURFACE &gt; SOILS &gt; CARBON</keyword>      <keyword>EARTH SCIENCE &gt; LAND SURFACE &gt; SOILS &gt; ORGANIC MATTER</keyword>      <keyword>EARTH SCIENCE &gt; LAND SURFACE &gt; SOILS &gt; SOIL CHEMISTRY</keyword>      <keyword>EARTH SCIENCE &gt; LAND SURFACE &gt; SOILS &gt; SOIL TEMPERATURE</keyword>      <keyword>EARTH SCIENCE &gt; LAND SURFACE &gt; SOILS &gt; SOIL MOISTURE/WATER CONTENT</keyword>      <keyword>EARTH SCIENCE &gt; LAND SURFACE &gt; SOILS &gt; SOIL PH</keyword>      <keywordThesaurus>VARIABLE:GCMD</keywordThesaurus>    </keywordSet>    <additionalInfo>      <section>        <title>Related References</title>        <para>Porras, R.C., Hicks Pries, C.E., McFarlane, K.J. et al.

All four sites are located within the temperate broadleaf deciduous forest zone. The vegetation is classified as eastern deciduous hardwood but dominant species differ by site. The UMBS soils are sandy, mixed, frigid, Entic and Lamellic Haplorthods, BEF soils are coarse, loamy, isotic, frigid, Typic Haplorthods, and the MOZ soils are fine, smectitic, mesic, Aquertic, Chromic Hapludalfs all of which are all considered “mature” soils, while the HAF soils are sandy, skeletal, mixed, mesic, Typic Dystrudepts that are classified as intermediate weathering-stage soils (Schaetzel and Anderson 2005). All soils are of Holocene age with similar mineralogic composition (Table 1) forming on glacigenic sediments deposited during the Wisconsin glaciation (11.0–11.7 kya) (Thompson et al. 1999; USDA Soil Survey 2001; Bergquist 2009). The soils from UMBS, HAF, and BEF were formed on glacial till and the MOZ soils were formed on loess (McFarlane et al. 2013).</para>          <para>Soil cores (10 cm in diameter × 90 cm deep or depth to bed rock) (Table 1) were collected in November–December 2007 from five 2 m × 2 m square plots located at each of the four study sites. The soils from all four sites have similar mineralogical composition except for enstatite, which was identified at HAF. Enstatite is a pyroxene group mineral, which tends to weather rapidly. Its presence at HAF is consistent with the assignment of an earlier weathering stage for the soils at this site based on the Jackson-Sherman weathering stage criteria (Sposito 2008). More detailed descriptions of site characteristics, as well as laboratory methods for physical fractionation of bulk soils, pH measurements, texture analysis, and results for the initial 14C characterization study are found in McFarlane et al. (2013).</para>        </description>      </methodStep>      <methodStep>        <description>          <para>Laboratory methods</para>          <para>Surface bulk (&lt;2 mm) soils from 0–5 and 5–15 cm depths were fractionated by density using a 1.65 g cm−3 density SPT solution as described in McFarlane et al. (2013). We performed all chemical extractions non-sequentially on the dense fraction (DF) isolated from the bulk soils. DF contained on average 70% of the soil mass and 60% of SOC across all sites and depths (McFarlane et al. 2013). In the current study, poorly crystalline Fe and Al oxides were selectively dissolved via a 4 h extraction in 0.2 M acid ammonium oxalate in the dark (Schwertmann 1964; Fey and LeRoux 1977; Hodges and Zelazny 1980). Operationally-defined organically-complexed Fe and Al (Fep and Alp) were extracted via reaction with 0.1 M Na-pyrophosphate (McKeague 1967; Ross and Wang 1993). Post reaction, samples were centrifuged at 3000 rpm followed by syringe filtration of the extract at 0.45 μm. Under the conditions of this study, it is not possible to assume the Na-pyrophosphate extractable Fe and Al were completely free of suspended colloidal material which has been noted in previous studies and attributed to the alkaline conditions of the extractant solution (e.g., pH 10; Schuppli et al. 1983); however, the effect was most pronounced in tropical soils characterized by clay content &gt;40%, and Schuppli et al. (1983) concluded the method is appropriate for use in temperate soils. Al and Fe in the filtered extractant solutions were quantified by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Process and reagent blanks were used to correct for Fe and Al impurities introduced during sample preparation. Operationally-defined poorly crystalline Fe (Feo-p) and Al (Alo-p) contents were estimated as the difference between Feo–Fep and Alo–Alp, where the o subscript denotes acid ammonium oxalate-extractable Fe and Al and the p subscript denotes sodium pyrophosphate extractable Fe and Al (McKeague et al. 1971).</para>        </description>      </methodStep>    </methods>    <project id="9cc37650-e339-4174-b9ba-a659d6fb244c" scope="system" system="ess-dive">      <title>Belowground Biogeochemistry Scientific Focus Area</title>      <personnel>        <individualName>          <givenName>Margaret</givenName>          <surName>Torn</surName>        </individualName>        <organizationName>Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory</organizationName>        <electronicMailAddress>mstorn@lbl.gov</electronicMailAddress>        <role>Principal Investigator</role>      </personnel>    </project>    <otherEntity id="ess-dive-11ef3d28a92ee19-20221027T225652343">      <entityName>SoilChemistrySiteCharac_RCP_20140307_EXP.csv</entityName>      <entityType>text/csv</entityType>    </otherEntity>    <otherEntity id="ess-dive-9df7a5860fc5629-20221027T225652362">      <entityName>SiteCharacteristics.png</entityName>      <entityType>image/png</entityType>    </otherEntity>    <otherEntity id="ess-dive-6d859d40e050150-20221027T225652355">      <entityName>SoilChemistryHeaders.csv</entityName>      <entityType>text/csv</entityType>    </otherEntity>  </dataset></eml:eml>
