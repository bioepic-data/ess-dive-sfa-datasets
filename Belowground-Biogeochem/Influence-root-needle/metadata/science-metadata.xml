We present results of a decade-long field study that traced the decomposition of 13C- and 15N-labeled Pinus ponderosa needle and fine root litter placed in O or A soil horizons of a sandy Alfisol under a coniferous forest. We measured the retention of litter-derived C and N in particulate (&gt;2 mm) and bulk soil (&lt;2 mm) fractions, as well as in density-separated free light and three mineral-associated fractions. After 10 years, the influence of slower initial mineralization of root litter compared to needle litter was still evident: almost twice as much root litter (44% of C) was retained than needle litter (22–28% of C). After 10 years, the O horizon retained more litter in coarse particulate matter implying the crucial comminution step was slower than in the A horizon, while the A horizon retained more litter in the finer bulk soil, where it was recovered in organo-mineral associations. Retention in these A horizon mineral-associated fractions was similar for roots and needles. Nearly 5% of the applied litter C (and almost 15% of the applied N) was in organo-mineral associations, which had centennial residence times and potential for long-term stabilization. Vertical movement of litter-derived C was minimal after a decade, but N was significantly more mobile. Overall, the legacy of initial litter quality influences total SOM retention; however, the potential for and mechanisms of long-term SOM stabilization are influenced not by litter type but by soil horizon.</para>      <para>This dataset comprises (1) litter recovery for each of 5 timepoints in &gt;2mm, &lt;2mm, and density fractions, (2) density fractionation results for the 10-year timepoint, and (3) vertical movement of applied litter.</para>    </abstract>    <keywordSet>      <keyword>EARTH SCIENCE &gt; LAND SURFACE &gt; SOILS</keyword>      <keywordThesaurus>CATEGORICAL:NONE</keywordThesaurus>    </keywordSet>    <keywordSet>      <keyword>EARTH SCIENCE &gt; LAND SURFACE &gt; SOILS &gt; CARBON</keyword>      <keyword>EARTH SCIENCE &gt; LAND SURFACE &gt; SOILS &gt; ORGANIC MATTER</keyword>      <keyword>EARTH SCIENCE &gt; BIOSPHERE &gt; ECOLOGICAL DYNAMICS &gt; ECOSYSTEM FUNCTIONS &gt; DECOMPOSITION</keyword>      <keywordThesaurus>VARIABLE:NONE</keywordThesaurus>    </keywordSet>    <additionalInfo>      <section>        <title>Related References</title>        <para>Hicks Pries, C.E., Bird, J.A., Castanha, C. et al.

Mean annual temperature is 12.5 °C and mean annual precipitation is 1774 mm, most of which falls as snow from November through March (Bird and Torn 2006). Soil temperatures generally remain above freezing and in many years the snow does not remain on the ground for more than a week at a time. The soils are classified as sandy, mixed, mesic Ultic haploxeralfs.</para>          <para>In 2001, labeled P. ponderosa needle (3.8 atom % 13C, 5.5 atom % 15N) and fine root (3.3 atom % 13C, 8.1 atom % 15N) litter was inserted into soil mesocosms (10.2 cm diameter by 23 cm deep schedule 40 PVC tube with two 5 cm diameter 450 μm mesh windows opposite one another) that had been driven into the soil to incubate at the field site (Bird and Torn 2006). The treatments were a factorial of litter type (fine roots or needles) and soil horizon (O or A) with n = 4. Litter was added to the mesocosms at rates of 147 and 135 g m−2 for needles and roots, respectively. Litter was placed within the 2–4 cm depth of the O or the 2–4 cm depth of the A horizon. The O horizon averaged 8 cm deep and about 15 cm of the A horizon was within the mesocosms (Bird and Torn 2006). The mesocosms were collected after 0.5, 1, 1.5 (Bird and Torn 2006; Bird et al. 2008), 5 (Hatton et al. 2015), and 10 years.</para>        </description>      </methodStep>    </methods>    <project id="9cc37650-e339-4174-b9ba-a659d6fb244c" scope="system" system="ess-dive">      <title>Belowground Biogeochemistry Scientific Focus Area</title>      <personnel>        <individualName>          <givenName>Margaret</givenName>          <surName>Torn</surName>        </individualName>        <organizationName>Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory</organizationName>        <electronicMailAddress>mstorn@lbl.gov</electronicMailAddress>        <role>Principal Investigator</role>      </personnel>    </project>    <otherEntity id="ess-dive-cae9ea1475c1026-20221027T232544261">      <entityName>10Year_Metadada.pdf</entityName>      <entityType>application/pdf</entityType>    </otherEntity>    <otherEntity id="ess-dive-1220ae656b18cf8-20221027T232500596">      <entityName>Transport_btw_horizons.csv</entityName>      <entityType>text/csv</entityType>    </otherEntity>    <otherEntity id="ess-dive-ec62fb85577dda0-20221027T232500593">      <entityName>DensFracData.csv</entityName>      <entityType>text/csv</entityType>    </otherEntity>    <otherEntity id="ess-dive-b546ee522b4b2be-20221027T232626432">      <entityName>SupplementaryMaterialBGC2017.pdf</entityName>      <entityType>application/pdf</entityType>    </otherEntity>    <otherEntity id="ess-dive-0279b97abdab9da-20221027T232500588">      <entityName>10yr_recoveries.csv</entityName>      <entityType>text/csv</entityType>    </otherEntity>  </dataset></eml:eml>
