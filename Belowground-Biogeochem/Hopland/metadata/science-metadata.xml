To elucidate these questions we measured the effects of soil warming (+ 4 °C), rhizosphere, and depth of litter placement on the decomposition of Avena fatua (wild oat grass) root litter in a Mediterranean grassland ecosystem. Field lysimeters were subjected to three environmental treatments (heating, control, and plant removal) and three 13C-labeled root litter addition treatments (to A horizon, to B horizon, and no-addition disturbance control) for each of two harvest time points. We buried root litter in February 2014 and measured loss of 13C in CO2 from the soil surface and in leachate as dissolved organic carbon (DOC) over two growing seasons. At the end of each of the 2014 and 2015 growing seasons we recovered the 13C remaining in the soil. Loss of root litter C occurred almost entirely via heterotrophic respiration, with an estimated &lt; 2% lost as DOC during the initial decay period. The added roots were broken down and incorporated into bulk soil material very quickly; only ~ 30% of added root was visible after 6 months. In the first growing season, decomposition occurred faster in the B than in the A horizon, the latter having greater moisture limitation. Subsequently, there was almost no further decomposition in the B horizon. After two growing seasons, less than 20% of the added root litter C remained in the A or B horizons of all environmental treatments. Heating did not stimulate decomposition, likely because it exacerbated the moisture limitation. However, while plots without plants dried down more slowly than plots with plants, their decomposition rate was not significantly greater, possibly due to the lack of rhizosphere processes such as priming. We conclude that in this Mediterranean grassland ecosystem, soil moisture, which is affected by season, depth, heating, and rhizosphere, plays a dominant role in mediating the effect of those factors on root litter decomposition, which after two seasons did not differ by depth or by treatment.</para>      <para>The files in this dataset comprise (1) 13C-labeled litter additions made to each plot, (2) litter recovery after each of 2 growing seasons, (3) periodical soil flux measurements, (4) leachate measurements, and continuously monitored soil (5) temperature and (6) moisture.</para>    </abstract>    <keywordSet>      <keyword>EARTH SCIENCE &gt; LAND SURFACE &gt; SOILS</keyword>      <keywordThesaurus>CATEGORICAL:GCMD</keywordThesaurus>    </keywordSet>    <keywordSet>      <keyword>EARTH SCIENCE &gt; LAND SURFACE &gt; SOILS &gt; CARBON</keyword>      <keyword>EARTH SCIENCE &gt; LAND SURFACE &gt; SOILS &gt; NITROGEN</keyword>      <keyword>EARTH SCIENCE &gt; LAND SURFACE &gt; SOILS &gt; SOIL RESPIRATION</keyword>      <keyword>EARTH SCIENCE &gt; LAND SURFACE &gt; SOILS &gt; SOIL TEMPERATURE</keyword>      <keyword>EARTH SCIENCE &gt; LAND SURFACE &gt; SOILS &gt; SOIL MOISTURE/WATER CONTENT</keyword>      <keywordThesaurus>VARIABLE:GCMD</keywordThesaurus>    </keywordSet>    <additionalInfo>      <section>        <title>Related References</title>        <para>Castanha, C., Zhu, B., Hicks Pries, C.E. et al.

The climate is Mediterranean with hot, dry summers and mild, rainy winters. Lysimeters were first established in the 1970s and rebuilt in 2008. They are buried within a sloped hillside to maintain the natural soil microclimate. Each lysimeter is contained in a steel drum (38 cm in diameter and 56 cm deep). The columns were packed with 33 cm of B-horizon Laughlin soil topped with 15 cm of A-horizon Laughlin soil from a nearby grassland. The lysimeters have a drain on the bottom, covered with filter fabric, 5 cm of clean sand and another layer of filter fabric. Each is plumbed to collect all water draining through the soil column in a 5 gallon glass carboy. The Laughlin series (fine-loamy, mixed, mesic Ultic Haploxeroll) is a typical grassland soil in the California North Coast region. SOC content decreases from 2.3% at the surface (0–8 cm) to 0.7% at depth (38–42 cm), while soil 13C − 28.0 to − 26.6‰ (Fig. S1). The lysimeters, or plots, were seeded in February 2014 and in October 2014 with an annual grassland mix of Avena barbata 40% (15 seeds, 16.0 g), Bromus hordeaceus 20% (25 seeds, 1.6 g), Vulpia myurous 20% (20 seeds, 0.3 g), and Achillea millefolium 20% (100 seeds, 0.1 g).</para>        </description>      </methodStep>      <methodStep>        <description>          <para>Experimental design</para>          <para>Treatments</para>          <para>Three environment factors were crossed with three substrate factors and replicated across four blocks. In total, 36 plots (3 × 3 × 4) were used in this study. The environment factors, designated as “treatments”, were control (ambient temperature, seeded), heated (ambient + 4 °C, seeded), and unplanted (ambient temperature, unseeded and weeded weekly). The three substrate factors, designated as “litter additions”, were root litter added to the A horizon (8–12 cm), root litter added to the B horizon (38–42 cm), and disturbance control (no root litter addition).</para>        </description>      </methodStep>      <methodStep>        <description>          <para>Plot design and soil microclimate monitoring</para>          <para>We divided each plot into quadrants, one for temperature and moisture sensors, two for litter addition and respiration measurements, and the last for plant biomass measurement and soil nutrient assays. A single 50 cm long heating cable (SLMCAB10120B, BriskHeat Corp, Ohio) was placed vertically in the center of each plot, inside a 1.9 cm steel conduit. Heating was controlled by a Campbell CR10X datalogger programmed to maintain a 4 °C difference in soil temperature between heated and control plots. Heating was initiated when litter was added in February 2014. Soil temperature was continuously monitored in the 12 disturbance-control plots—four each of control, heated, and unplanted treatments—using custom-made probes with thermistors (Omega 44005, USA) installed at 10 and 40 cm. Soil moisture was continuously monitored in the 12 disturbance-control plots—four each of control and heated treatments at 10 and 40 cm depth and four of the unplanted treatments at 10 cm depth only—using EC-5 moisture sensors (Decagon, USA). In December 2014 we installed dual temperature/moisture sensors (5TM, Decagon, USA) in 28 additional plots: Each of the four unplanted disturbance-control plots that previously had moisture sensors only at 10 cm depth received a 5TM sensor at 40 cm depth, and each of the 24 litter-addition plots that previously had no sensors received a 5TM sensor at 10 cm depth.</para>        </description>      </methodStep>      <methodStep>        <description>          <para>Litter additions</para>          <para>In February 2014 we added 13C-labeled Avena fatua roots (0.463 g C g root−1, 5.6 atom%, grown for 12 weeks in a labeling chamber alternating ambient CO2 with 10 atom% 13CO2 every 3–4 days at the University of California (UC), Berkeley to either the A (8–12 cm) or B (38–42 cm) horizon in each of two quadrants per plot. Using a 3.8-cm diameter auger we removed soil from a sequence of depth intervals (0–8, 8–12, 12–20, 20–30, 30–38, and 38–42 cm). We cut root litter into ~ 1 cm long pieces and mixed it in soil that had been removed from either 8–12 or 38–42 cm depths. We subsequently repacked the soil from each depth interval into its original depth interval. While all 36 plots experienced the same disturbance, only 24 plots received root litter addition—to either the A or the B horizon. The labeled litter was added to two quadrats of every plot, and one quadrat was harvested at the end of each of two growing seasons. Each litter addition consisted on average of 0.123 g of root material per soil core, corresponding to 109 g root m−2 of the augered area.</para>        </description>      </methodStep>      <methodStep>        <description>          <para>Sampling and analyses</para>          <para>Soil CO2 fluxes</para>          <para>Surface CO2 fluxes were measured from 10-cm diameter PVC collars, which were centered over the litter addition, once prior to the addition of labeled root litter. Following root litter addition and plant germination, surface CO2 and 13CO2 fluxes were measured four times each during the first and second growing seasons (on 3/15/14, 4/5/14, 5/7/14, 5/20/14, 12/18/14, 2/3/15, 3/18/15, and 4/23/15). As plants were not clipped inside the collar, the measured CO2 fluxes represent ecosystem respiration (including respiration from aboveground plants and belowground plants and microbes). In the first growing season, we used a Li-Cor 6400 analyzer and a Li-Cor 6400-09 soil respiration chamber to measure CO2 flux and 1 M NaOH solution static trapping (24-hour) to measure the 13C value of CO2 flux. The trapped CO2 was precipitated as SrCO3 and measured for 13C (Harris et al. 1997). In the second growing season, we used a Cavity Ringdown Spectrometer (G2131-i, Picarro, USA) to measure CO2 and the Keeling-plot method to determine 13CO2. We conducted these measurements over a 5 min period on one collar per plot.</para>        </description>      </methodStep>      <methodStep>        <description>          <para>Dissolved C in leachate</para>          <para>Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) losses were quantified over the course of the study. After precipitation events we collected leachate from the bottom of each lysimeter (on 3/4/14, 3/15/14, 4/5/14, 5/7/14, 12/5/14, 12/11/14, 2/18/15, and 2/23/15). Leachate was weighed to determine volume and a subsample was frozen for analysis. In the lab, the subsamples were thawed and filtered through 0.45 μm acrodisc supor membrane filters (Pall Corporation, Switzerland) prior to analysis. The 0.45 μm pore size was chosen following a test that showed no difference (p = 0.85) in total organic carbon recovered after filtration through 0.2 μm, 0.45 μm, and control (no filter). Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was calculated by taking the difference of total carbon and inorganic carbon (IC), which were measured directly with a TOC-V CSH Analyzer (Shimadzu, Japan). To obtain DO13C (3/4/14 and 3/15/14 samples only), subsamples were sent to the Stable Isotope Facility at UC Davis where they were acidified and purged prior to being run on a 1030 TOC Analyzer (OI Analytical, College Station, TX) interfaced to a PDZ Europa 20-20 isotope ratio mass spectrometer (Sercon Ltd., Cheshire, UK). The contribution of labeled root carbon to DOC was determined to be a very small fraction of the applied litter (&lt; 0.2%), and previous studies showed that leaching losses occurred mainly in the initial period after burial, so samples from subsequent time points were only measured for DOC and not DO13C.</para>        </description>      </methodStep>      <methodStep>        <description>          <para>Root litter 13C recovery in soil</para>          <para>We recovered the soil to which the root litter had been applied after the first growing season in August 2014 and again at the end of the second growing season in May 2015 using a 7.6 cm diameter × 45 cm long corer with a slide hammer attachment (AMS samplers Inc., USA). The intact cores were recovered in plastic liners, and capped. In 2014, we cut the cores into 0–5, 5–10, 10–15, 15–20, 20–35, 35–40, and 40–45 cm increments. We processed all depth increments of the disturbance control plots, the 5–20 cm sections of the plots with A horizon litter additions, and the 35–45 cm sections of the plots with B horizon litter additions. In 2015, we cut the cores into 0–7, 7–14, 14–20, 20–35, and 35–45 cm increments, and processed the 7–14, 14–20 and 35–45 cm sections of the disturbance control plots, the 7–14 and 14–20 sections of the plots with A horizon addition, and the 35–45 cm increment of the plots with B horizon addition. These sections spanned the depths to which root-litter was added (8–12 or 38–42 cm), and allow for potential downward movement of added root litter (Fig. S4).</para>          <para>In the lab, samples from each depth increment were weighed and then passed through a 2 mm sieve. Gravimetric water content was determined on a subsample of the 2 mm soil. Rocks &gt; 2 mm were separated and weighed. Coarse roots, including long roots that passed through the sieve, were separated by hand-picking for &lt; 1 min. The 2 mm soils were subsampled using the cone-and-quarter technique to obtain a &lt; 100 g aliquot for further processing. Subsamples were weighed, and visible roots were hand picked (for 10 min per 50 g for shallow samples up to 14 cm depth and 5 min per 50 g for deeper samples) for heated and control plot samples. The root picking effort was halved for unplanted plot samples. Roots were washed and dried at 55 °C for 24 h, then weighed. The remaining “bulk” soil subsample was ground on a roller mill to pass a 250 µm mesh. Soil, coarse root, and fine root samples were analyzed for C and 13C at UC Berkeley (IsoPrime 100 IRMS in line with a Vario micro cube EA, Isoprime, UK).</para>          <para>We determined the proportion of carbon in our samples that was derived from the labeled litter (P litter ), in the leachate or solid samples, using a two end-member mixing model:</para>          <para>𝑃𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑟=(𝐶𝑠𝑎𝑚𝑝𝑙𝑒−𝐶𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑜𝑙)/(𝐶𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑟−𝐶𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑜𝑙),</para>          <para>where C sample is the fractional abundance of 13C in the sample under consideration, C control is the average fractional abundance of 13C in the disturbance control (calculated separately for each sampling and treatment), and C litter is the fractional abundance of 13C in the applied litter. For the solid samples, C control was calculated separately for the A and B horizons and P litter was calculated for the root and bulk soil fractions. Litter recovery—in bulk soil, roots, leachate, or respired CO2—was reported as the fraction of applied litter C recovered. Recovery as a fraction of applied litter was calculated by multiplying the proportion of carbon derived from the labeled litter (P litter ) by the mass of carbon recovered in those samples divided by the mass of carbon initially applied as litter.</para>          <para>Litter applied to the A horizon was found across various depth increments, namely the 5–10, 10–15, and 15–20 cm increments in 2014, and the 7–14 and 14–20 cm increments in 2015. And litter applied to the B horizon was found in the 35–40 and 40–45 cm increments in 2014, and the 35–45 cm increment in 2015. C sample and C control were therefore calculated for the entire depth increment under consideration. Based on statistical differences across groups, bulk soil C control was calculated separately by year and by horizon, and averaged across treatments. On the same basis, root C control was calculated separately by year, and averaged across horizons and treatments.</para>        </description>      </methodStep>    </methods>    <project id="9cc37650-e339-4174-b9ba-a659d6fb244c" scope="system" system="ess-dive">      <title>Belowground Biogeochemistry Scientific Focus Area</title>      <personnel>        <individualName>          <givenName>Margaret</givenName>          <surName>Torn</surName>        </individualName>        <organizationName>Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory</organizationName>        <electronicMailAddress>mstorn@lbl.gov</electronicMailAddress>        <role>Principal Investigator</role>      </personnel>    </project>    <otherEntity id="ess-dive-fed59715b40f0c2-20221022T000904159">      <entityName>EM50_Hopland_M_means_daily.csv</entityName>      <entityType>text/csv</entityType>    </otherEntity>    <otherEntity id="ess-dive-10428968c02b5dd-20221026T214129779">      <entityName>LitterAddnRecovery_ColumnHeaders.csv</entityName>      <entityType>text/csv</entityType>    </otherEntity>    <otherEntity id="ess-dive-c109d9dadee7575-20221022T000904165">      <entityName>Hop_LabeledLitterAddn.csv</entityName>      <entityType>text/csv</entityType>    </otherEntity>    <otherEntity id="ess-dive-8beb34ed2429673-20221022T000904154">      <entityName>CR10X_Hopland_T_means_daily.csv</entityName>      <entityType>text/csv</entityType>    </otherEntity>    <otherEntity id="ess-dive-5dd634c0c25f82a-20221022T000904187">      <entityName>LitterAddnRecovery.csv</entityName>      <entityType>text/csv</entityType>    </otherEntity>    <otherEntity id="ess-dive-bb71998ddbf6d87-20221022T000904170">      <entityName>HopFluxAll20160617_4R.csv</entityName>      <entityType>text/csv</entityType>    </otherEntity>    <otherEntity id="ess-dive-9784856caf6e0ac-20221026T213015270">      <entityName>HP_Leachate_Lys_All_20160703.csv</entityName>      <entityType>text/csv</entityType>    </otherEntity>  </dataset></eml:eml>
